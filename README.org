* ControlCL

ControlCL is a GUI library, which is very inspired by [[https://github.com/sojamo/controlp5][controlp5]] for the [[https://processing.org/][Processing]] environment. Though I have not used Processing in a long term, I always liked the Look and Feel of the controlp5 library and the ease of use.

Hence I make an attempt to port some portions of it to Common Lisp and sdl2. The goal is not to make a complete copy, but provide functionality as needed, thereby learning about CL and sdl2.

* Installation

Ultralisp is required (cl-sdl2-hershey). The controlcl library is not yet on ultralisp. Clone the repository to get started. Getting started implies most like getting Pull Requests ready. Alternatively try using qlot. The project is in the process of being set up for use with qlot.

The Makefile as is, implies that qlot is installed and that the libraries have been installed using qlot.
