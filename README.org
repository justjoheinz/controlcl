* ControlCL

ControlCL is a GUI library, which is very inspired by [[https://github.com/sojamo/controlp5][controlp5]] for the [[https://processing.org/][Processing]] environment. Though I have not used Processing in a long term, I always liked the Look and Feel of the controlp5 library and the ease of use.

Hence I make an attempt to port some portions of it to Common Lisp and sdl2. The goal is not to make a complete copy, but provide functionality as needed, thereby learning about CL and sdl2.

* Installation

Ultralisp is required (cl-sdl2-hershey). This library is not yet on ultralisp. Clone the repository to get started. Getting started implies most like getting Pull Request ready.
